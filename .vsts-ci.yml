# CI and PR build script
#
# There should be no deep magic here. The developer experience and CI experience
# must remain as close to one another as possible.
#
# Developer experience:
#   npm install
#   (make changes)
#   npm test
#   vsce package
#   (give VSIX to someone for buddy testing)


steps:
- script: npm install
  displayName: npm install

# - script: npm test
#   displayName: npm test
#   continueOnError: true

# Set version number for PR/CI or release
- ${{ if startsWith(variables['Build.SourceBranch'], 'refs/heads/releases/') }}:
  - template: ci/version-release.yml
- ${{ if not(startsWith(variables['Build.SourceBranch'], 'refs/heads/releases/')) }}:
  - template: ci/version-ci.yml

# This is nothing more than `npm install -g vsce && vsce package`, but
# we don't have sudo on the CI system.
- script: |
    mkdir ~/.npm-global
    export NPM_CONFIG_PREFIX=~/.npm-global
    export PATH=~/.npm-global/bin:$PATH
    npm install -g vsce
    vsce package
